# Results Plan

The main results are latency and throughput.

## Charts


### Best configuration for each cluster size

Show for each application and platform, the best configuration for each cluster size regarding latency, throughput and resource usage.

### Latency x Scalability

Show the latency as the number of nodes is increased for each application, comparing the platforms. For each cluster size, pick the best configuration.

### Throughput x Scalability

Show the throughput as the number of nodes is increased for each application, comparing the platforms. For each cluster size, pick the best configuration.

### Resource Usage (Efficiency)

Compare for each application in each platform the efficiency as the number of nodes is increased.

It commonly decreases as the number of nodes increases, as more overhead is added to the system and resources are never fully used.


### Producer Performance (Kafka)

Just a side note on Kafka as the cluster is static (3 nodes as both brokers and producers).
